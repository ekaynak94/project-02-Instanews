## Personal Experience

This was the second webpage I have built as a part of the RED Academy Web Developer Professional program. It was a good project to practice the HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge I have aquired from the previous project as well as to learn about the topics listed above. Trying to figure out and master the new tools Sass and Scss introduces to CSS styling was a fun experience. I also enjoyed having Gulp run time consuming tasks for me. But my biggest takeaway from this project as Developer student, and what I think will be very useful for me in the future is having learned about jSON data format and working with APIs.
